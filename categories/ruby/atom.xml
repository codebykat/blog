    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently had to implement this workflow for a client project, and it got a little confusing.  There&rsquo;s a lot of example code floating around, but it took some trial and error to get everything working smoothly.  So, on the off-chance it&rsquo;ll be helpful for someone else, here&rsquo;s a walkthrough that illustrates the complete package.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Caveat: ActiveResource <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3818223">has been removed from Rails core</a>, and I hear there may be better solutions out there for interacting with remote APIs.  At the outset of this project it seemed like the best way to quickly get things working, but your mileage may vary.</p>

<a href="#frontend">Part 2: The Front End</a><br />
<a href="#part3">Part 3: The Fiddly Bits</a></p>

<h2><a id='part0'>Part 0: The Big Picture</a></h2>

<p>The basic architecture consists of two Rails sites:</p>

<p><strong>The Backend:</strong> A pure JSON API that authenticates users via Devise&rsquo;s token_authenticatable module.  Uses ActiveRecord database models, no session storage.</p>

<p><strong>The Front End:</strong> A client that signs users in by requesting and storing a token from the backend.  Uses session storage and ActiveResource models.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll talk about the configuration for each of these separately, and then some of the integration work (read: hacking) I had to do to get everything running smoothly.</p>

<p><strong>Security Warning!</strong> This setup is <strong>completely insecure</strong> if used over HTTP (since email/password are sent in plaintext).  You definitely want to ensure that your front end communicates with your backend strictly via HTTPS in order to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>

<h2><a id='backend'>Part 1: The Backend</a></h2>

<h3>1. Install Devise</h3>

<p>This is covered well elsewhere so I won’t get into it.  Add ‘devise’ to your gemfile and check out the Devise <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#getting-started">documentation</a> for basic setup.  <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/209-introducing-devise?view=asciicast">RailsCasts</a> are also a great resource for this.</p>

<h3>2. Configure Devise to use :token_authenticatable</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://rdoc.info/github/plataformatec/devise/master/Devise/Models/TokenAuthenticatable">token_authenticatable</a> module adds authentication tokens to a model and sets it up so Devise can use them to log users in.</p>

<p>First, we need a new database column.  Older versions of Devise had the t.token_authenticatable shorthand for this, but that is now deprecated, so we need to set up the column and index manually.</p>

<p>Create a new database migration:</p>

<pre><code>class AddTokensToUsers &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    change_table :users do |t|
      t.string :authentication_token
    end
    add_index  :users, :authentication_token, :unique =&gt; true
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Tell Devise to use tokens for the User model by adding :token_authenticatable to the devise line in your model, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :token_authenticatable,
       :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable
</code></pre>

<p>Then a few small changes to the Devise config (config/initializers/devise.rb):</p>

<pre><code>config.skip_session_storage = [:http_auth, :token_auth]
config.token_authentication_key = :auth_token
</code></pre>

<p>The first line tells Devise not to store the user in the session.</p>

<p>The second line changes what you’re going to call your authentication token parameter &mdash; I changed mine to &ldquo;auth_token&rdquo; because I didn&rsquo;t want to be typing &ldquo;authentication_token&rdquo; all the time, but you can call it whatever you want (or leave it as the default).</p>

<p>Now any protected content needs to be wrapped with a filter that tells it to deny access if the user is not authenticated.  In my Users controller, I added:</p>

<pre><code>before_filter :authenticate_user!, :except =&gt; [:create, :new, :show]
</code></pre>

<p>So now we have all the infrastructure in place.  Next, we need a way to actually authenticate the user.  That&rsquo;s the job of the Sessions controller, which checks a given username and password and, if they&rsquo;re valid, returns a token (as well as the ID of the user in question).  Note that, since there’s no session-based sign-in on the backend, we never call Devise&rsquo;s sign_in/sign_out methods.  We&rsquo;re just validating the password, making sure the user has an auth token generated, and returning it.</p>

<p>(In some sense, a user is &ldquo;signed in&rdquo; to the backend as long as they have a valid authentication token.  If you want, you can expire this token after some period of time instead of having it stick around indefinitely.  You could also reset it after a certain number of uses.)</p>

<pre><code>SessionsController:
    def create
        build_resource
        resource = User.find_for_database_authentication(:email =&gt; params[:email])
        return invalid_login_attempt unless resource

        if resource.valid_password?(params[:password])
        resource.ensure_authentication_token!  #make sure the user has a token generated
        render :json =&gt; { :authentication_token =&gt; resource.authentication_token, :user_id =&gt; resource.id }, :status =&gt; :created
        return
    end
end

def destroy
    # expire auth token
    @user=User.where(:authentication_token=&gt;params[:auth_token]).first
    @user.reset_authentication_token!
    render :json =&gt; { :message =&gt; ["Session deleted."] },  :success =&gt; true, :status =&gt; :ok
end

def invalid_login_attempt
    warden.custom_failure!
    render :json =&gt; { :errors =&gt; ["Invalid email or password."] },  :success =&gt; false, :status =&gt; :unauthorized
end
</code></pre>

<p>On login, we call @user.ensure_authentication_token! to make sure the user has a token saved.  You could also add this call to your User#create method to generate the token when the user is first created.</p>

<p>When the session is destroyed, we call @user.reset_authentication_token! to expire the current token and generate a new one.</p>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is making sure you have sign_in and sign_out routes.  This should actually be a given if you have Devise set up correctly, but just to cover all the bases, a simple devise_for call in config/routes.rb will route /users/sign_in and /users/sign_out to the right places:</p>

<pre><code>devise_for(:users, :controllers =&gt; { :sessions =&gt; "sessions" })

$ rake routes
user_session            POST    /users/sign_in(.:format)    sessions#create
destroy_user_session    DELETE  /users/sign_out(.:format)   sessions#destroy
</code></pre>

<p>Now you should be able to test the backend via curl or an app like <a href="http://ditchnet.org/httpclient/">HTTPClient</a>.  Here&rsquo;s a quick cheat sheet to test that everything&rsquo;s working properly.  This assumes you&rsquo;ve already created a user on the backend.  Obviously, replace &ldquo;localhost:3000&rdquo; with your test URL.</p>

<pre><code>curl http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in --data "email=me@example.com&amp;password=secret"
# should return the token and user ID.

curl http://localhost:3000/a_protected_page
# no token - should return 401 Unauthorized.

curl http://localhost:3000/a_protected_page&amp;auth_token={token}
# should return the requested information.

curl -x DELETE http://localhost:3000/users/sign_out&amp;auth_token={token}
# should log out the user, changing the authentication token.
</code></pre>

<p>All good?  Now we just have to set it up so the front end knows how to play this game.</p>

<h2><a id='frontend'>Part 2: The Front End</a></h2>

<p>The front end does not have Devise installed.  We don’t need it, because the user and session models are so simple, almost stubs.  All they do is add a layer of abstraction to the API calls.  You could probably still use Devise to manage your sessions and templates, but since I&rsquo;m using custom sign in and registration templates, it felt like overkill.</p>

<p>The user model on the front end is just an ActiveResource model whose site points to the backend URL.</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveResource::Base
    self.site = "http://localhost:3000"  # your backend URL here
end
</code></pre>

<p>We have another custom Sessions Controller on the front end which is responsible for managing login and logout.  It sends the provided email and password to the backend and saves the returned token and user ID in the session cookie.</p>

<pre><code>class SessionsController &lt; ApplicationController

    def create
        # uses ActiveResource custom REST method
        # POST to @user.site/users/sign_in with params email/password and receive a token in return
        response = User.post(:sign_in, :email =&gt; params[:username], :password =&gt; params[:password])
        if response.code == "201"
            response_body = JSON.parse(response.body)
            session[:auth_token] = response_body["authentication_token"]
            session[:current_user_id] = response_body["user_id"]
        else
            # handle errors gracefully
        end

        redirect_to root_url and return
    end

    def destroy
        # DELETE to @user.site/users/sign_out
        response = User.delete(:sign_out)
        # TODO might want to check response to make sure it worked..

        # clean up our session and instance variables
        session.delete(:auth_token)
        session.delete(:current_user_id)
        @current_user = nil

        redirect_to root_url and return
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Oh, know what else would be nice?  A helper method to see if we’re logged in and get the current user, similar to the one Devise provides.  This goes in the Application controller:</p>

<pre><code>helper_method :current_user

protected
def current_user
    @_current_user ||= session[:current_user_id] &amp;&amp; User.find(session[:current_user_id])
end
</code></pre>

<p> So, cool, now you can refer to current_user from templates just like in Devise.</p>

<h2><a id='part3'>Part 3. The Fiddly Bits</a></h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s only one piece missing: appending the stored authentication token to every backend API call.  I didn&rsquo;t expect this to be the hard part, but&hellip; now it gets complicated.</p>

<p>Basically, ActiveResource doesn’t support this use case.  You can set an extra parameter on the object, but then ActiveResource will pass it wrapped up as part of the object, not on its own, which will break the Devise magic on the backend.</p>

<pre><code>@user.auth_token = token
# the backend gets {:user =&gt; {:email =&gt; "me@example.com", ... :auth_token =&gt; token}}
</code></pre>

<p>Some ActiveResource methods <em>do</em> support passing extra parameters, but you can&rsquo;t do it for every method, the format is inconsistent (and apparently undocumented), and we don&rsquo;t want to type all that out all the time anyway&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>&gt; User.delete(:sign_out, :auth_token =&gt; session[:auth_token])
# that works, but...
&gt; g = Group.find(:first, :params =&gt; {:auth_token =&gt; session[:auth_token])
# hmm... that works too, but the format is different...
&gt; g.name = "edited name"
&gt; g.save!
ActiveResource::UnauthorizedAccess: Failed.  Response code = 401.  Response message = Unauthorized .
# whoops... what about...
&gt; Group.site = "http://localhost:3030?auth_token=" . session[:auth_token]
&gt; g.save!
ActiveResource::UnauthorizedAccess: Failed.  Response code = 401.  Response message = Unauthorized .
# OK, this is getting ugly...
&gt; g.save!(:auth_token =&gt; "wh5xeZpwf6zHG9aHzy6M")
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)
# fine then!
&gt; g.put(g)
URI::InvalidURIError: bad URI(is not URI?): /groups/1/#&lt;Group:0x007fe0d4998880&gt;.json
#  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻) 
</code></pre>

<p>OK, look, forget it.  What we <em>really</em> want is a way to automatically send the authentication token, if we have it, with every single request &mdash; in a way that works transparently with ActiveResource, so it won&rsquo;t matter if we&rsquo;re doing a find, update, or delete.</p>

<p>As it happens, you can overload ActiveResource&rsquo;s basic HTTP authentication functionality to add the token to the headers on every request.  The catch is that we then have to add some more backend code, to pull the token out of the header and treat it like an ordinary param.</p>

<p>Clear as mud?  Let&rsquo;s look at the code.</p>

<p>First, the front end.</p>

<p>ActiveResource supports HTTP digest authentication: if you set a user and password on the ActiveResource object, they will get passed with every request, just like we want (albeit as a header, not a parameter).  But we don&rsquo;t want to set the <em>same</em> token for the entire class (since each user will have their own token), so instead of putting it in the model, we&rsquo;ll have to add a filter to set it each time.</p>

<p>First, add the following function to the &ldquo;protected&rdquo; section of the Application controller:</p>

<pre><code>def set_auth_token
    User.user = session[:auth_token]
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then, add a filter near the top, so we call this function for every request:</p>

<pre><code>before_filter :set_auth_token
</code></pre>

<p>If you examine the request sent to the backend, you&rsquo;ll see that it now contains a &ldquo;HTTP-AUTHORIZATION&rdquo; header.  So far, so good.</p>

<p>Side note: If you have multiple ActiveResource models interacting with the backend, you will have to set the user on each one.   For example: &ldquo;Group.user = session[:auth_token]&rdquo;.  The &ldquo;user&rdquo; (i.e., token) will then be sent for every Group request, such as Group.find, @group.save, etc.</p>

<p>Now ActiveResource is sending the auth_token in the header, but the backend is expecting to find it as a GET or POST parameter.  So we need a little hack on the backend to fish it out, thus allowing Devise to continue transparently handling authentication.</p>

<p>To the backend code!</p>

<pre><code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
    prepend_before_filter :get_auth_token

    private
    def get_auth_token
        if auth_token = params[:auth_token].blank? &amp;&amp; request.headers["HTTP_AUTHORIZATION"]
            # we're overloading ActiveResource's Basic HTTP authentication here, so we need to
            # do some unpacking of the auth token and re-save it as a parameter.
            params[:auth_token] = auth_token.split.last.unpack('m').first.chop
        end
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah, ActiveResource is also encrypting that token, and then sending it in the HTTP digest format &ldquo;user:password&rdquo;.  Since we didn&rsquo;t set the password and used our auth_token as the user string, we&rsquo;re looking at &ldquo;encryptedtoken:&rdquo; instead.</p>

<p>So we throw a little string manipulation dance party: split/last/unpack/first/chop, swing your partner, do-si-do!  This unencrypts the token, chops the colon off the end, and adds it to the params for every request so Devise can validate it.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s it &mdash; feels like a bit of a hack, but seems to work pretty well in practice.  Has anyone else implemented a system like this?  I&rsquo;d love to hear how you did it!</p>

    <link href="http://blog.codebykat.com/2011/10/03/rubyconf-recap/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-03T10:58:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.codebykat.com/2011/10/03/rubyconf-recap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf 2011</a> was my first technical conference
as a Rubyist, and it was an absolute blast.  I was afraid that many of
the talks would be too advanced, since I&rsquo;ve been writing Ruby for less
than a year, but on the whole there was a good mix for programmers at
any level.  Not only did I learn a ton, I got to spend three days
rubbing elbows with a bunch of smart, inspiring and genuinely nice
folks. It was great to put faces to some of the names I&rsquo;d seen online
and get to hear about what everyone&rsquo;s working on.  As my first real dose
of the Ruby community, the experience was nothing but positive.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>My main takeaways from the conference: I want to be more involved with
the Ruby/open-source community, my tests are terrible (well, that&rsquo;s not really news),
and concurrency/threading is a hot topic in the Ruby world right now.  Oh,
and now I understand what these variants everyone is always talking about (JRuby,
Rubinius, etc.) actually are!</p>

<p>The three days of <a href="http://rubyconf.org/schedule">talks</a> ran the gamut
from general to specialized, from little toy programs to big
multi-person projects. What follows is not exhaustive by any means: just
my notes, what I found the most interesting and memorable.  (All the
talks were recorded by <a href="http://confreaks.net/">confreaks</a>; videos should
be available <a href="http://confreaks.net/events/rubyconf2011">here</a> sometime
soon.)</p>

<h2>Zach Holman: <a href="http://rubyconf.org/presentations/62">How Github Uses Github to Build Github</a></h2>

<p>Zach Holman&rsquo;s talk was mainly about Github&rsquo;s corporate culture and the
organic, <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/2011/10/01/github-is-anarchy-for-programmers.html">slightly anarchistic</a>
process (or, if you prefer, anti-process) they use to manage the
<a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> codebase.
Zach talked about
his experiences with a team that works asynchronously: geographically
and temporally separate, without deadlines, meetings, interruptions, or
any other sort of unnecessary overhead.
Quite a bit of interesting stuff
here &mdash; it&rsquo;d definitely be worth watching the video.</p>

<p>As appealing as all of this sounds, as with any process, what works well
for one specific group wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily translate well to a
different setting.  Someone in the audience did point out that Github
doesn&rsquo;t have any clients, and thus can be more flexible about deadlines.
I do think that it hits the nail on the head in terms of developer
motivation and efficiency, so even if you can&rsquo;t adopt it wholesale, it&rsquo;s
worth looking at to see if any of the pieces might be a good fit.  If
nothing else, I&rsquo;m sure that offering so much autonomy ensures that
Github attracts some of the best developers out there.</p>

<p>Pikimal developers actually do work asynchronously quite a bit (we have
a persistent chatroom, somewhat flexible hours and many opportunities to
work remotely).  If we could figure out how to adapt it to our workflow,
I think there might be something to be learned from the Github
treatment of deadlines and scheduling.  As for deployment, I would <em>definitely</em> love to make
our continuous integration and build process more robust, as it&rsquo;s a big
source of developer stress for us right now.</p>

<h2>Rob Sanheim: <a href="http://rubyconf.org/presentations/49">How Getting Buff Can Make You a Better Rubyist</a></h2>

<p>Rob Sanheim has this outlandish idea that taking good care of
yourself will make you a better programmer.  He&rsquo;s preaching to the
choir, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned; I&rsquo;ve thought for some time that the
hacker myth (i.e., that there&rsquo;s some kind of merit in coding night and day,
fueled by coffee and Red Bull) can&rsquo;t die soon enough.  As Rob said,
&ldquo;We need to move away from a culture where working crazy hours and
pulling all-nighters is [considered] a good way to get things done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I love that he not only talked about his own experience in finding more
balance in his life, but provided some real data (neuroscience and
statistics) about why this is a great idea.
This has been my experience as well: the time you lose in taking better
care of yourself is more than recovered in better focus, more energy,
more creativity and just improved sanity generally.  (After this talk, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dddagradi">@dddagradi</a> and I decided to officially start <a href="http://www.c25k.com/">c25k</a>.  We&rsquo;ve done the first two runs already!)</p>

<p>Also: Getting everyone up to do &ldquo;programmer yoga&rdquo; at the beginning of the talk?  Total win.</p>

<h2>Steven Harms: <a href="http://rubyconf.org/presentations/56">Practical Metaprogramming</a> vs. Joshua Ballanco: <a href="http://rubyconf.org/presentations/30">Keeping Ruby Reasonable</a></h2>

<p>I loved these two talks because they showcased some of the interesting (and sometimes worrying) things
that can happen with a language like Ruby that allows you to dynamically
add or override function bindings in the running environment.</p>

<p>Steven Harms used these powers for good, illustrating his talk with the real-life
example of a program that models Latin verbs.  He made the concept of &ldquo;metaprogramming&rdquo;
seem much less scary and mysterious, and provided a beautifully-organized taxonomy of
metaprogramming patterns.  I did find his project extra interesting because learning Japanese is
a (sadly somewhat neglected) side project of mine, so I always love talking about
modeling human languages in terms of code.</p>

<p>Joshua Ballanc, on the other hand, had some very funny examples to illustrate how this powerful ability
can be used in problematic ways, and why this can be bad (&ldquo;in this variation [of first-class environments],
the user simply cannot reason about his code&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Jamis' <a href="http://bit.ly/pghOIG">hand-drawn slides</a> are amazing and
adorable.  Seriously, go play with them, they&rsquo;re even interactive!  While
the concepts will be old hat for anyone with a CS background,
I loved the sense of playfulness and exploration.  This is what programming
is all about.  (Also, I kind of want to write some maze-generation code
now.)</p>

<h2>Dr Nic Williams: <a href="http://rubyconf.org/presentations/18">Threading vs Evented</a></h2>

<p>This is a talk I walked into wondering whether I&rsquo;d understand anything,
but it was actually quite interesting (and funny; I swear Dr Nic is
secretly a stand-up comedian).  His slides don&rsquo;t seem to be online, but
I&rsquo;ll be sure to link the video once it&rsquo;s up.  Lots of great info about
multithreading in Ruby, best practices and some of the underlying
implementation issues.</p>

<p>The basic takeaway was that, currently, the <em>only</em> way to get good
performance with multithreading in Ruby is with the stack of nginx +
Trinidad + JRuby. I was surprised to learn that the reference Ruby
implementation is <del>single-threaded</del> often limited to a single
Ruby thread per processor<super>*</super> (and, judging from some of the Q&amp;As,
this may not be fixed anytime soon).  Word on the street, by the way, is
that Rubinius is working on better concurrency support as well.</p>

<p><small>(<super>*</super>Updated with clarification from @merbist and @steveklabnik.  Thanks guys!)</small></p>

<p>Interesting side note: I looked up the GIL on Wikipedia
and learned that Python is in exactly the same situation (the vanilla C implementation
has a GIL but the Java-based version &mdash; in Python&rsquo;s case, Jython &mdash; does
not).</p>

<h2>Steve Klabnik: <a href="http://rubyconf.org/presentations/55">Shoes</a> + Ron Evans: <a href="http://rubyconf.org/presentations/51">KidsRuby</a></h2>

<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just the years I spent working for various universities, but
I&rsquo;m always interested in teaching tools and serious games. I think
projects like HacketyHack and KidsRuby are a great way to make
programming more accessible to the next generation, many of whom don&rsquo;t have
access to any kind of formal CS education.
Both Steve Klabnik and Ron Evans emphasize (and exemplify) the passion and
natural curiosity that is so fundamental to our vocation as coders.</p>

<h2>Gregory Moeck: <a href="http://rubyconf.org/presentations/21">Why You Don&rsquo;t Get Mock Objects</a> + Chris Parsons: <a href="http://rubyconf.org/presentations/12">Your Tests are Lying to You</a></h2>

<p>I admit it: my test-fu is weak.  I don&rsquo;t write tests as often as I
should, and when I do write them, I often copy-and-paste bits and pieces
of other tests without fully understanding how they work.  So Gregory
Moeck&rsquo;s discussion of mock objects, including some simple rules for how
to use them, was very enlightening.  His slides were full of pithy
little rules of thumb like &ldquo;Mock roles, not objects&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mocks assert on
messages&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Only mock types you own&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I actually missed the other testing talk, &ldquo;Your Tests are Lying to You&rdquo;,
but I heard a lot about it after the fact, so I looked up and enjoyed
the slides. I&rsquo;m putting them here, too, for your edification and to
remind myself to check out the video when it gets posted.</p>
